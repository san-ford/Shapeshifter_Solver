# Shapeshifter Solver

This code helps solve one of my childhood games, called Shapeshifter. It uses a depth-first search algorithm to iterate through every possible move until a solution is found. There may be many solutions to each puzzle, but it is only necessary to find one, so the first solution found is returned.

The initial commit is only a proof of concept. The code is a work in progress, which will probably only be updated occasionally.
